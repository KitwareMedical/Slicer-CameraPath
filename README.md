# IVSPlan: the Intelligent Virtual Surgical Planning application software

This project was created as a sandbox to design surgical planning tools leveraging 3D Slicer and the Slicer Custom App Template. **This project is not currently maintained. See the 3D Slicer [discourse forum] to learn how we plan to reuse some of IVSPlan's features in 3D Slicer**

[`3D Slicer`] is an open-source and extensible application for visualization and medical image analysis. 3D Slicer works with optical imaging, MRI, CT, and ultrasound data.

The [`Slicer Custom App Template`] is a template developed by Kitware to be used as a starting point for creating a custom 3D Slicer application. IVSPlan uses an older/deprecated version of the Slicer Custom App Template, which was 

At [Kitware], we have applied 3D Slicer to research and commercial applications ranging from pre-clinical animal studies, to surgical planning and guidance, to ultrasound image analysis, to medical robot control, to population studies.
